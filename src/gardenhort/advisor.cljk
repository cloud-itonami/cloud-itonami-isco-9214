  "Garden and Horticultural Labourer Advisor — proposing a garden/
  horticultural-site scheduling/logistics coordination operation (log a
  planting/maintenance-log/progress record, schedule a crew operation,
  flag a safety concern, coordinate a plants/soil/tool-supplies
  procurement order) from a crew roster, site registration and safety-
  reporting policy. Swappable mock/llm; the advisor ONLY proposes —
  `gardenhort.governor` independently gates every proposal and always
  escalates safety concerns and above-threshold supply orders. The
  advisor never proposes to directly finalize a garden-work-execution
  decision (e.g. finalizing the garden-maintenance operation), or a
  site-safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring the site safety
  cleared), and never proposes to override a site safety supervisor's
  judgment — those stay permanently out of this actor's scope. Modeled
  closely on cloud-itonami-isco-9212's livestockfarm.advisor for the
  outdoor-labour hazard-domain shape, adapted to the power-tool hazard
  (mowers, trimmers, hedge cutters) / pesticide-and-fertilizer chemical
  exposure / outdoor weather exposure dimension of garden and
  horticultural work.
