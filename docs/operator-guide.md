# Operator Guide

## First Deployment

1. Define the operator's site coverage and crew intake process.
2. Define consent and purpose categories for worker/site records.
3. Run synthetic operating cases (work-log entry, crew-operation
   scheduling, supply coordination, safety-concern flagging).
4. Enable human-reviewed sign-off for `:high`/`:safety-critical` actions
   (all flagged safety concerns, above-threshold supply orders).
5. Measure operating outcomes and audit coverage.

## Minimum Production Controls

- consent and disclosure log
- safety-critical escalation path (power-tool hazard, pesticide/
  fertilizer chemical-exposure hazard, outdoor weather-exposure hazard)
- provenance for all operating records (worker and site both
  independently registered)
- human review for high-risk cases
- audit export for all gated actions
- a hard, unconditional block on any attempt to route a garden-work-
  execution decision, a site-safety-clearance decision (e.g. declaring
  the site safety cleared), or a site-safety-supervisor override
  decision, through this actor — those decisions stay a site safety
  supervisor's exclusive authority end to end

## Certification

Certified operators must prove that the governor gates every
safety-critical robot action, that safety-critical risks escalate to
humans, and that no deployment configuration can route a garden-work-
execution decision, a site-safety-clearance decision, or a site-safety-
supervisor judgment override through this actor.
